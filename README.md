# Splunk_LAB
This lab focused on configuring Splunk to collect system logs from a Windows 11 machine and building an alert to detect suspicious authentication events.

Cybersecurity Homelab Projects
Welcome to my personal Cybersecurity Homelab repository! This space is where I document hands-on labs and real-world security configurations I've completed as part of my self-guided training journey into roles like SOC Analyst, Risk Analyst, and Security Operations.

🔍 What's Inside
This repo contains detailed Markdown reports (in human-readable language) for the following labs:

SIEM Log Analysis & Alert Tuning (Splunk)
Vulnerability Management Workflow (Nessus)
Network Threat Detection (Suricata + Raspberry Pi 5)
Cloud Security Tools Overview (AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty) ← Deprecated due to billing concerns
Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Documentation (Coming Soon)
Each lab showcases real work—from configuring routers and VLANs to writing detection rules and performing risk assessments.

🧠 Goal
Build a solid and practical foundation in cybersecurity using affordable hardware, open-source tools, and enterprise-grade configurations—while demonstrating my problem-solving, documentation, and technical skills.

💼 Why This Matters
This repo serves as my public portfolio for potential employers. It reflects my initiative, troubleshooting mindset, and ability to work through realistic security environments.
